    "Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a method for optimizing expensive black-box functions by means of a probabilistic surrogate model and an acquisition function that specifies a trade-off between exploration (improving the surrogate) and exploitation (finding the minimizer of the surrogate and thus of the black-box function).\n",
    "\n",
    "As **surrogate model** typically Gaussians processes (GP) or tree-based models (RF, GBT ...) are used. These have their own parameters that need to be estimated via maximum likelihood or integrated out.\n",
    "The maximum likelihood (ML) point estimate is typically searched using a gradient-based local optimizer is used together with a heuristic such as multiple restarts to deal with the non-convexiy of the problem.\n",
    "For integrating out the model parameters either Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or approximate variational inference (VI) methods have to be used, together with an assumption on the prior distribution. As with the ML estimation, the problem is non-convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search spaces** define the possible inputs. When applying BO for tuning hyperparameters of machine learning models the inputs include continuous, integer / ordinal and categorical variables and may include conditionals. When applying BO to optimization of real-world processes additional (in-)equality constraints may need to be satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Acquistion functions** either have a analytic form, or need to be approximated via Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "We want to find the minimizer of the acquistion over the search space in order to evaluate it next.\n",
    "This is typically done using a gradient-free or gradient-based local optimizer or via MC-sampling, depending on the nature of the acquistion function.\n",
    "The search space including its constraints needs to be handled by the optimizer.\n",
    "In multi-objective BO the black-box function has multiple target outputs. Here the acquisition function needs to guide the search towards exploring the Pareto front.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of general-purpose (not focussing only on hyperparameter tuning) BO frameworks available in Python and R. In the main frameworks are compared in terms of supported features and development & support activity."
